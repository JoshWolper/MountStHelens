# MountStHelens
Using pixel heightmap data, compute the surface distance from pixel A to pixel B.

# Running
    g++ computeSurfaceDistance.cpp -o run.exe
    ./run.exe
# Changing Query Points
The main distance computing function is called in main, simply change the values of (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in these function calls to query other A's and B's!
